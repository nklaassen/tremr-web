    TREMR aims to assist PD (Parkinson’s Disease) patients in gaining a sense of control over their
    disease and motivate them to continue fighting. TREMR will do this by allowing users to
    track their tremors with a step by step audio walkthrough of how to track each type of tremor,
    track what and how much of each medication they are taking, and even to input and track
    specific daily/weekly exercises given to them by their medical professional. Our app will then
    graph this data and PD patients will better be able to see how their actions affect the progress of
    their disease. The data will also be easily sent to the patient’s medical professional to give further
    insight into each individual case.
    </p>
    <p align="center">
    TREMR is designed with accessibility at its core to remove usability and technology challenges
    for elderly PD patients. TREMR tracks tremor severity, medications and doctor-provided
    exercises. The user will also be able to set up reminders so that TREMR notifies them when to
    perform a tremor measurement, take their medication, or do their exercises.
    Patients suffering from PD should download this app because it is a user friendly way to track
    and monitor the progress of their disease. Furthermore, this will supply valuable data to the
    medical professional so that they can customize a treatment plan.
